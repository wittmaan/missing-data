# Machine Learning development from <br> model-centric to data-centric

Andrew Ng: “When a system isn’t performing well, many teams instinctually try to improve the code. But for many practical applications, it’s more effective instead to focus on improving the data,”

## model-centric view

- Collect what data you can, and develop a model good enough to deal with the noise
in the data.

- Hold the data fixed and iteratively improve the code/model.

## data-centric view
- The consistency of the data is paramount. Use tools to improve the data quality
$\rightarrow$ this will allow multiple models to do well.

- Hold the model fixed and iteratively improve the data.

# From big data to good data 

MLOps' most important taks: ensure consistently high-quality data in all phases of 
the ML project lifecycle.

**Good data is:**

- Defined consistently (definition of labels y is unambiguous )
- Cover of important cases (good coverage of inputs x)
- Has timely feedback from production data (distribution covers data drift and concept drift)
- Sized appropriately

# Good data without missing data

- Getting high-quality data also includes tackling noise data

- Data can become noise caused of missings

## Missing data

- Industrial data can have different challanges
  - privacy
  - expense
  - machine or human mistakes

---

# The problem

- Many AI/ML/Data science methods are developed for complete data

- Inappropriate approach imposes noise or bias on data
